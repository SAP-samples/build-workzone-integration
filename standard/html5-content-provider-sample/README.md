# Sample HTML5 Business Solution as Content Provider

In order to enable any HTML5 business solution (could be a simple UI5 application or advanced CAP application with multiple Fiori applications) to be accessed in SAP Build Work Zone as Content Provider, the app must include the Work Zone content definition which must be provided as per Content Data Model (CDM) schema defined [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/creating-cdm-json-file-for-multi-tenancy-html5-app).

Here you can find the sample HTML5 business solution projects that contain cdm.json as reference examples.
